        Beside repairs and restoration, making my own instruments and set-up work, 
        I also offer other instruments for sale. 
        Looking for an upgrade from your current instrument? 
        I have a small stock of violins and violas for various budgets. 
      </p>

        If you would like to try one of these instruments head on over to 
        the contact page to set up an appointment.
